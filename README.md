FrogKing.java was created in 2019 for my Java Programming course game project. 

## Gameplay

### Mission

The goal of the game is for your character, the Frog King, to catch as many flies as he can in order to survive. To catch a fly, the player must first answer a physics question right — if you do, you receive 10 points. Otherwise, there is no change. 

To learn concepts, the player must interact with a treasure chest when it appears on the screen. The information in these treasure chests will aid in solving the physics problems.

Additionally, the Frog King must avoid enemies, which vary by level. If an enemy is touched, the player must answer a physics question — if you answer wrong, you lose 10 points and one life (you are given three in total). Otherwise, you proceed normally.
